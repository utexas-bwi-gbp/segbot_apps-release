ros-hydro-segbot-navigation (0.3.1-0raring) raring; urgency=high

  * Allow explicit amcl laser max range paramter instantiation. closes #31 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/segbot_apps/issues/31>.
  * Closes #29 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/segbot_apps/issues/29>
    - Get latest version of move_base to get fix introduced in https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/pull/295
    This allows setting tolerance to 0 when calling make_plan from segbot_logical_translator.
    - Don't use any tolerance when testing whether a door was open or not.
    - Don't clear costmap around robot when testing for an open door.
  * Increase local costmap size to 8m x 8m. Increasing obstacle and raytrace range for primary laser to match. Closes #26 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/segbot_apps/issues/26>.
  * updated planner frequency to 1.0. Closes #25 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/segbot_apps/issues/25>

ros-hydro-segbot-navigation (0.3.0-0raring) raring; urgency=high

  * a number of navigation changes to allow for correct navigation with multiple namespaced robots, and use the multimap.
  * fixed a bunch of catkin_lint errors. also installed missing scripts. closes #23 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/segbot_apps/issues/23>
  * added better approach point determination. only navigate via the current location
  * Fixed nan_to_inf filter, still testing laser on new robot.
  * revised map_server's node name to make it unique
  * tuned many of the amcl parameters to make navigation better.
  * Made the door checker test for the door to be open 3 times before going through. Works much better.

ros-hydro-segbot-navigation (0.2.0-0raring) raring; urgency=high

  * use ``roslaunch_add_files_check()`` to test that required launch
    file dependencies are declared.

ros-hydro-segbot-navigation (0.1.0-0raring) raring; urgency=high

  * removed redundant doc file
  * uncommented runtime launch dependencies on navigation and eband_local_planner as they have not been released into hydro yet
  * catkinized segbot_apps
  * updating the eband visualization configuration for hydro-devel
  * increased footprint size to produce an inscribed radius of 0.3
  * fixed footprint location while waiting for ros-planning/navigation#63 <https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/issues/63> to be fixed
  * commenting out hydro-devel navigation test code. This should not be checked in until navigation through hydro-devel is fixed
  * changes to prepare for the catkinization of eband_local_planner against hydro-devel in navigation
  * some improvements to navigation
  * fixed a bug in the eband trajectory controller
  * in-place rotation at goal now supported
  * merged goal tolerance parameters between local planner and trajectory controller.
  * add launch for e-band navigation
  * fixed for the regular nav stack launch file as well. closes #1 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/segbot_apps/issues/1>
  * hmm not sure why this file was here
  * fix for the eband costmap having an incorrect topic. #1 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/segbot_apps/issues/1>
  * updated launch file to use any visualization configuration + reorganized eband configuration file
  * checking in new parameters for the eband local planner
  * inital differential drive trajectory controller - looks pretty good. needs a bit more code improvent, dynamic reconfigure and stricter obstacle testing
  * removed some unnecessary launch files and added an rviz configuration + launch file for testing autonomous navigation
  * basic amcl + move base demo works (but is not very good)
  * removed old ens basement maps from the repo
  * removed joy gmapping file - joystick control not directly supported
  * removed redundant sensor files (moved to segbot_sensors)
  * initial port of of navigation and controller code from the svn repository
