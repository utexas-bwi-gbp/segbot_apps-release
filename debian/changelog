ros-hydro-segbot-navigation (0.1.0-0quantal) quantal; urgency=high

  * removed redundant doc file
  * uncommented runtime launch dependencies on navigation and eband_local_planner as they have not been released into hydro yet
  * catkinized segbot_apps
  * updating the eband visualization configuration for hydro-devel
  * increased footprint size to produce an inscribed radius of 0.3
  * fixed footprint location while waiting for ros-planning/navigation#63 <https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/issues/63> to be fixed
  * commenting out hydro-devel navigation test code. This should not be checked in until navigation through hydro-devel is fixed
  * changes to prepare for the catkinization of eband_local_planner against hydro-devel in navigation
  * some improvements to navigation
  * fixed a bug in the eband trajectory controller
  * in-place rotation at goal now supported
  * merged goal tolerance parameters between local planner and trajectory controller.
  * add launch for e-band navigation
  * fixed for the regular nav stack launch file as well. closes #1 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/segbot_apps/issues/1>
  * hmm not sure why this file was here
  * fix for the eband costmap having an incorrect topic. #1 <https://github.com/utexas-bwi/segbot_apps/issues/1>
  * updated launch file to use any visualization configuration + reorganized eband configuration file
  * checking in new parameters for the eband local planner
  * inital differential drive trajectory controller - looks pretty good. needs a bit more code improvent, dynamic reconfigure and stricter obstacle testing
  * removed some unnecessary launch files and added an rviz configuration + launch file for testing autonomous navigation
  * basic amcl + move base demo works (but is not very good)
  * removed old ens basement maps from the repo
  * removed joy gmapping file - joystick control not directly supported
  * removed redundant sensor files (moved to segbot_sensors)
  * initial port of of navigation and controller code from the svn repository
